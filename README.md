Credits :

- Biz Markie, Public Enemey, John Oswald, Negativland, The Residents, Herb Alpert, Marcel Duchamp, Pete Machnik, ad infinitum ...
- Tamats, whose original Freesound romper directly inspired this creation, serving as a constant blueprint and pointing the way to a reductionist interaction paradigm nestled in the twilight of scarcity.
- Scott Schiller's Soundmanager2 library, more relevant ever, delivering ubiquity and stability where standards have failed.
- Danny Garcia, for the beautifully succinct "FIL" micro-framework, which served as a low-level scaffold for this project.
- Patrick Cox (Codepen) for the nifty loader CSS ;)
- FREESOUND, BRAM, G-ROMA, FFONT, UPF, and the entire Freesound community!
