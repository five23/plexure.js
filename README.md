Inspiration :

- Biz Markie, Public Enemey, John Oswald, Negativland, The Residents, Herb Alpert, Marcel Duchamp, Pete Machnik

Credits :

- Tamats, whose original Freesound romper directly inspired this creation, serving as a constant blueprint and pointing the way to a reductionist interaction paradigm nestled in the twilight of scarcity.

- Soundmanager2, strangely relevant, delivering ubiquity and stability where standards have failed.

- Danny Garcia, for the beautifully succinct "FIL" micro-framework, which served as a low-level scaffold for this project.

- FREESOUND, BRAM, G-ROMA, FFONT, UPF!!!!!!!
